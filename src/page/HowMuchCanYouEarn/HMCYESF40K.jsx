2. **Skilled Trades**: Electricians, plumbers, or carpenters can earn significant hourly wages in San Francisco, and working part-time can still lead to substantial earnings due to the high demand for these trades.

3. **Bartending/Serving at High-End Restaurants**: San Francisco has a strong dining scene, and bartenders or servers at upscale restaurants can earn $30–$50 per hour, including tips. Working part-time could still result in a $40k yearly income.
