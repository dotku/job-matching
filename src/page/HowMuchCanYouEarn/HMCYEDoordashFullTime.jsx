In the gig economy, DoorDash has become one of the most popular platforms for drivers looking to make money with flexible hours. However, is the income from driving for DoorDash really as good as it seems? Let’s dive deep into the numbers and uncover the true earnings for DoorDash drivers in 2024. In this post, I’ll walk you through the potential earnings, the associated costs, and ways to reduce expenses as a full-time driver.

## Evaluating Orders: Is It Worth It?

Take, for example, an order offering $10 for driving seven miles. On the surface, this might look like a good deal. But once you factor in expenses like gas and wear and tear on your vehicle, the profit shrinks to about $7.40 for the seven-mile drive. These calculations can vary depending on the type of vehicle you drive, but I’ll base this breakdown on my own experience driving a 2016 Chevy Cruze, which averages around 30 miles per gallon.

## Understanding Your Expenses as a Full-Time DoorDash Driver

If you drive for DoorDash full-time, understanding your expenses is crucial to calculating your true earnings. 
Let me take you through one of my recent shifts to give you an idea of what this looks like in practice. 
During a 12-hour shift, I earned $126.55, driving a total of 232 miles.

### Expenses Breakdown

- **Gas**: With my vehicle, I spend approximately $0.10 per mile on gas, which amounted to $23.20 for that shift.
- **Car Wear and Tear**: I set aside 10% of my earnings for car maintenance, which was $12.
- **Taxes**: Another 10% went towards taxes, or $12.60 for the day.

After subtracting these costs, my earnings for the day dropped to $78.75, meaning I earned an hourly average of just **$6.57**—well below minimum wage.

## Full-Time Earnings and Annual Projections

If you work full-time for DoorDash, you can expect to make around $20 per hour, although this can vary depending on the market you’re in. 
Let’s assume you drive one mile for every dollar you earn, and you work 40 hours per week, averaging $20 per hour. 
That would give you an annual income of $41,600, driving 41,600 miles in the process.

### Annual Expenses Overview

- **Gas**: Assuming a similar car to mine, with an average gas price of $2.50 to $3.00, you’d spend approximately $3,640 on gas annually.
- **Tires**: Driving this many miles will likely require a new set of tires each year, which costs about $1,000. 
  I recommend getting high-quality tires, such as Michelin, to ensure longevity and reliability.
- **Brakes and Rotors**: Expect to spend around $500 annually on brakes and rotors, as well as brake fluid changes.
- **Oil Changes**: With frequent driving, oil changes are necessary every 3,000 to 5,000 miles. This would mean about 10 oil changes per year, costing around $500.
- **Miscellaneous Car Maintenance**: Unexpected expenses like an AC breakdown or other repairs can add up to around $1,000 annually.
- **Taxes**: With the standard mileage deduction, you can expect to pay around $4,118 in taxes, depending on your state and other factors.

### Total Annual Expenses
After adding up all these expenses, you’re looking at a total cost of $10,758 per year. This means that, after expenses, 
your net income would be $30,842 for a full year of work, averaging just **$14.83** per hour.

## How to Lower Your Expenses and Boost Your Profit

While the earnings might seem discouraging, there are several ways you can significantly reduce your expenses and increase your take-home pay.

### 1. **Drive a More Fuel-Efficient Car**
Switching to a more fuel-efficient vehicle, such as a Prius, can make a big difference. A Prius gets around 59 miles per gallon, 
meaning you could cut your gas expenses by nearly half. This could save you around $1,820 annually.

### 2. **Perform Your Own Oil Changes**
If you’re comfortable working on your car, doing your own oil changes can save you around $20 per oil change, which adds up to $200 per year.

### 3. **Drive Carefully to Avoid Unnecessary Costs**
Being cautious on the road can reduce the risk of accidents or tire damage, potentially saving you up to $1,000 in miscellaneous expenses each year.

### 4. **Use an Expense-Tracking App**
Apps like Solo not only help you track your expenses but also assist with tax filing. By using an accountant or tax service, you could potentially save up to $2,000 in taxes.

## Conclusion

While driving for DoorDash offers flexibility and the opportunity to be your own boss, the income potential is not as high as it may initially seem. 
After accounting for all expenses, you may find that your hourly wage is lower than expected, and there are other jobs that offer better pay. 
However, by managing your expenses wisely and making strategic decisions, such as driving a more fuel-efficient car or performing your own maintenance, 
you can maximize your earnings and reduce your costs.

If you’re a DoorDash driver or considering becoming one, I hope this breakdown helps you understand how much you’re truly making and what steps you can take to keep more of your hard-earned money.`}
