        <h3>summary</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            The content is about a 24-hour DoorDash challenge where the creator
            must accept every single order. They set three goals: accept all
            orders for 24 hours, make at least $410 to cover a radiator cost,
            and maintain mental sanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite facing heavy rain, long waits, low-paying offers, and poor
            driving conditions, the creator pushes through, tracking their miles
            and expenses using an app.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 24 hours, he earns <strong>$451.25</strong>, drive 383 miles,
            and net a <strong>$309.17</strong> profit after expenses, which
            would be <strong>$12.88/hr</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            He successfully completes two of the three goals but question their
            mental state, citing a strange dream. As punishment for failing the
            third goal, he chug a drink.

        <h3>full transcription</h3>
        <p>
          I have to take every single DoorDash order for 24 hours straight. All
          right, ladies and gentlemen, first order is up and it's a solid one.
          There is five dollar peak bay because it's pouring rain and it's four
          in the morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three goals I have to achieve by the end of this challenge.
          Number one, I have to accept every single DoorDash order for 24 hours
          straight. Obviously, that's the title of the video.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two, I have to make 410 dollars because that's how much my new
          radiator costs, so I need to make all of that back. And three, keep my
          mental sanity. If I fail to do so, number three is going to be the
          hardest, obviously.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have to do some sort of punishment at the end that will be decided
          at the end of the video. And no, I'm not just saying that because I
          don't have it right now. All right, after 26 minutes of waiting, we
          get this McDonald's offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Honestly, five dollars for 1.2 miles. I'm going to take it. Oh,
          obviously, I'm going to.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's the name of the video. Two things, if you're new here, this is
          D-Bag, our DoorDash bag. He's been with me for four years and he
          consistently lets me down every single day, so that's why I call him
          D-Bag.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, I think McDonald's is the one place in the world that could
          take 12 minutes when there's one order. Another solid offer, five
          dollars and 50 cents for 1.5 miles. Obviously, we have to take it.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's the point of the video. You get it. But we are one hour in and
          we have 17 dollars, which at 5 a.m. is surprisingly good.
        </p>
        <p>
          And second, we have 11 miles. So our dollar per mile is better than a
          dollar per mile. But once the no tippers wake up, that's when all hell
          breaks loose.
        </p>
        <p>
          I guess you wonder where I've been. If you had to take like a wild
          guess, like the wildest guess where the next order is from. Oh yeah,
          McDonald's.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is our first like, I wouldn't take this on a normal day, but
          still, I mean, only one mile. I can't really complain. So a lot of
          people have been giving me crap because D-Bag is blown to smithereens
          and torn to shreds.
        </p>
        <p>
          But yeah, he's keeping the food dry. I do have an insulated bag that
          I'll be using later, but my lunch is in that right now. And I don't
          want my lunch getting all nasty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come on. It's 6 a.m. That needs to make it to at least 10 a.m. All
          right, fine. It didn't make it to 10 a.m. It's, it's 6, it's 620 in
          the morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I mean for 628 a.m. This is juicy. I think I pulled a muscle. Juicy,
          juicy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was just thinking to myself, wow, I'm so happy that we're staying in
          my, hey, oh, caught ya. I was just thinking to myself, wow, this is
          great. I get to stay in my market.
        </p>
        <p>
          I haven't really gone too far. Bam! Uh, I mean the dollar per mile is
          better than a dollar per mile, but that is going into nowheresville.
          And yes, yes, I did put this on.
        </p>
        <p>
          So on the surface, you know, 825, 7.6 miles, not terrible. Uh, it's
          going into the middle of nowhere though. So pretty much double that
          mileage.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's how much mileage we have. As you can tell, it is just pissing
          rain still. We are four hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hey, we are four hours in and we have $66.23 and we've driven a total
          of 75 miles. Yes, we've lost our dollar per mile. Thank you, DoorDash.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who put that on? All right. One of my favorite things ever trying to
          get these big ass McDonald's bags into the DoorDash bag. Oh, you suck.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please go in. Ladies and gents, I will tell you what's not juicy right
          now. And that is this weather.
        </p>
        <p>It is just horrible. It is pouring. There is flooding.</p>
        <p>
          I am committed to get 24 hours, but these roads are, are balls. We're
          a little bit over a quarter of the way done. We're at six hours and we
          have $101.78 and we have 95 miles driven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Somehow, some way we got to a dollar per mile. Just picked up the
          order. Just listen to it out there.
        </p>
        <p>Oh, my camera's soaked. That was a dumb idea. Dumb.</p>
        <p>
          That took a little bit longer than I would have liked. I guess you
          wonder where I've been. We love it.
        </p>
        <p>
          An extra $4 added on to that delivery, making it $13 for 10 miles,
          which is pretty solid. I almost died. All right, it's officially 1235
          and I've eaten my lunch and my dinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          So now this bag takes over as our door dash bag and you can take a
          damn hike. Get the hell out of here. The hell do you think you are?
          All right, dude.
        </p>
        <p>
          What the flip? Hmm. We are now nine hours in and we have $160.65 and
          have driven a whopping 139 miles. Just got to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, get out of the road. Oh, now you're mocking
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come on, pick up the pace. Oh, you couldn't care less. Through all of
          the clownery today, we've raised our acceptance rate so far from 50%
          to 59%.
        </p>
        <p>
          And why do you choose to completely fall over? The goal is 70% by the
          end of the day. All right, well, that was easy. They ordered 12 cans
          of Chef Boyardee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like they just dropped $38 on Chef Boyardee. They're single handedly
          keeping this company in stock right now because I haven't had Chef
          Boyardee since I was four, which was 20 years ago. But hey, it's damn
          good.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's all I remember. Comment down below if you remember the Chef
          Boyardee commercial, which was juicy. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
          we are 10 hours in and we have $184.11 and 147 total miles driven,
          which is honestly better than a dollar per mile.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we'll take it. Still have 14 hours. After 40 minutes of waiting, we
          finally get hit with an offer and it is so garbage.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not good. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that just took 45 minutes
          to make $4.75. We love that. Two roads.
        </p>
        <p>
          Excuse me, windshield wipers. Two roads completely flooded. I get to
          the drop off location.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's just a college. It puts me in the middle of the college. Where in
          the college? But nonetheless, this should help us out a little bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I mean. Another added tip onto the end of the order after dropping
          it off. Life was good.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, bam, just a ball sack of an order. We are officially halfway
          done. 12 hours through.
        </p>
        <p>Just picked up the order. Let's go down the checklist. One.</p>
        <p>
          Except every order. 24 hours straight. Yeah, still on pace for that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Number two, $410. We're currently not on pace for that. We're at $198.
        </p>
        <p>
          And number three, keep my mental sanity. We'll circle back to that.
          For the first time, I think all day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have no clue. I can't remember anything to be honest at this point.
          But juicy.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is a juicy offer. $11.14 for only three and a half miles. Juicy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had to bring out the catering bag. Don't bring the catering bag.
          Everybody is getting a piece of the action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pizza bag is now up. Oh, you suck. Our acceptance rate is now up to
          63%.
        </p>
        <p>
          We've moved up 13% in 13 hours. The new rule I just created right now
          is I get one on a sign. No questions asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that was it right there. $450 for two orders. And the lady said it
          was going to be a 15 minute wait for the Chinese food.
        </p>
        <p>And then I have to go pick up the other order. Yeah, no. I'm not.</p>
        <p>
          No. That order, my friends, was ready right away. And that's juicy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We like that a lot. This is, you are not. Who do you think you are?
          We're gonna need a bigger bag.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm talking to insulated bags. 14 hours of this. This is what happens.
        </p>
        <p>
          14 hours down. We have $243.50. And we've driven 203 miles. My poor
          car.
        </p>
        <p>
          10 hours to go. Seriously? I don't know. Hour 15 officially started.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have nine hours to go. I have not a single morsel of caffeine in me
          and I'm still rolling. So we're gonna see what happens.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm going to hold off on it as long as possible. And then hopefully it
          gives me a last kick of energy at the end. Dog.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got hit with this offer. I'm like, all right, that's not terrible.
          And then the add-on is just.
        </p>
        <p>
          God, that is. Oh, that's horrible. I did not think a double stack
          dairy queen was in my cards tonight.
        </p>
        <p>
          The feels like temperature is 27 degrees right now. This guy looks
          cool. Whoa.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back on track. We are now 16 hours in and we have $283. And I've
          driven a total of 242 miles.
        </p>
        <p>You're doing good. Doing good, buddy. Good job.</p>
        <p>
          We're dipping into some caffeine. Got Celsius. This stuff's like jet
          fuel for not only my bloodstream, but also my colon.
        </p>
        <p>
          We just reached the goal of 70% acceptance rate. And DoorDash goes.
          Juicy offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          That might be the first time in Buffalo Wild Wings history that they
          have a mobile order ready right when you walk in. I don't know about
          you, but Buffalo Wild Wings takes like nine years usually. And you're
          just sitting there twiddling your thumbs.
        </p>
        <p>
          All right. Officially hour 17. And I usually don't drink caffeine so I
          can feel my heart currently in my throat.
        </p>
        <p>
          But good times, honestly. It was bound to happen. Things were getting
          a little too nice.
        </p>
        <p>
          You know, it's never a good sign when there is 15 people waiting for
          orders. No, that was a lie. Just pretend like I'm sitting down in the
          car again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, you know, it's a... Damn it. Oh, it's never good when you're in an
          order. Oh, no.
        </p>
        <p>
          I messed up again. Oh, you know, it's never... Damn it. You know,
          you're getting into the late times of... I can't even speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          You know, you're getting into... No. Uh, 7D8. Hey, congratulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          You officially made the thumbnail. But PS, I hate you. I'm joking.
        </p>
        <p>I'm joking. You too. 18 hours in now.</p>
        <p>
          We have 280 miles total plus this amount. Also, I have a pickup for
          Mod Pizza. There's not a soul in this parking lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Damn, it was open. I guess you wonder where I've been. Just picked up
          all the orders here.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last customer texted me and said, that's not my house. But that is
          the exact address you put, ma'am. And I also called you twice.
        </p>
        <p>
          And you did not respond until five minutes after I said hi. I'm just
          leaving this shit in the lobby. Honey, that's on you.
        </p>
        <p>I did everything I could. Go in. Hour 19.</p>
        <p>
          Five more to go. 20 hours down. And we have $359.75. And we've driven
          a total of 314 miles.
        </p>
        <p>
          And my heart is running about a million miles per second. So I'm
          feeling great. I also got this order.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm gonna go pick it up. As I was picking up that offer, I got a Baby
          Juicy offer right there. It's just a Baby Juicy add-on.
        </p>
        <p>
          All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are 21 hours in. I gotta be quiet
          because it's like two in the morning. $389.50 and 330 miles driven.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 1 47 a.m., I got hit with a Juicy offer. And then it's like, hey,
          you want an add-on? Juicy, another add-on. This is two Juicy offers at
          1 47 a.m. 22 hours down.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could have done without that. As I wait a year and a half for this
          light to change, once this order is dropped off, we have one and a
          half hours remaining of accepting every single DoorDash order. 24
          hours straight.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is actually the same guy. One of these is just Heinz ketchup.
          Dude ordered a butt ton of food and was like, shit, I need ketchup.
        </p>
        <p>
          I just waited about 72 seconds for a stop sign to turn green. 35
          minutes. You couldn't just keep me in this zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had 30 more minutes. All right, it's the next morning. I slept two
          hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what better way to go over the numbers than right now? After 24
          total hours, we made $451.25 and drove a total of 383 miles. Giving us
          $1.18 per mile and an average of $18.80 per hour before expenses.
          Factoring in expenses, we spent $68.52 on gas, $38.30 on car
          maintenance at 10 cents per mile and taxes.

          So I used the Solo app to track my miles. You can check out the link
          in the description, sign up using my link and get a free trial of
          seven days and then maybe get a bonus after you sign up. Just saying,
          just saying, I'm just saying.

          Using the app to track my miles, it showed my approximate tax
          deduction of $219.25. Subtracting this number from our total profit,
          we get $232 which is the amount we can get taxed on and at 15.2% tax
          rate, we got $35.26 in total taxes. Now the reason I didn't do this in
          my 12-hour video was because everyone gets up in arms about taxes and
          how they're done and oh, you can sign off this, you can write off
          this, yada, yada, yada. So taking our total profit and subtracting it
          by all of our expenses here, we get a total profit of $309.17 or
          $12.88 of total profit.

          Yikes. Lastly, our acceptance rate moved from a 50% to a 76%. So if
          all goes well, we will be top cloud, I mean, top dasher next month and
          checking our goals, one, yes, we door-to-ass for 24 hours straight,
          accepting every single offer.

          Yes, we made over $410 so check that off and step three, last night in
          the short amount of sleep I had, I had a dream where I picked up a
          Taco Bell offer and when I went to unzip it to deliver it to the
          customer, a giant taco consumed me entirely. So step three is
          definitely up in the air. So bye.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subscribe. Bye. Technically, I didn't complete goal three so I'm just
          gonna chug this as my punishment.
        </p>
        <p>That's horrible.</p>
