# DESIGN

In general, we want to create the most efficent way to help out both job seeker
to find the best job they want and help recruiters or company clients to find
the best people they want.

## Job Seeker

Defentily, we need build the profile for the job seekers. We can create
something similar to linkedin profile, or just simply sync with the linkedin
profile. But if it is just duplicate the linkedin, it won't be fun. Hance, we
want to create a job seeking system that help job seeker to find the job easier.
Here is the list of features we want to create.

1. Company List  
List the companies job seekers want to join.

2. Interview Progress Tracking System  
When a job seeker is activitly looking for job, he/she might
face the problem that there are too many schedules or there is
almost no schedule, the platform should give the job seeker
advice (eg. resume improvement by keywords advice) or feedback
that how to arrage the schedule (eg show which company would
be a better fit by showing them the company profile from chrunchbase).

## Recruiter

When I was finding jobs, I feel different recruiter could have different impact
on your job seeking. Some of them might help you improve your resume, others
could give you advice on interviewing.

In genral, they are helpful, and they tried their best way to serve job seekers.

## Company

Many companies have their own recuiting system. We might just integrate their 
existing recruiting system.
